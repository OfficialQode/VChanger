# FAQ

  

## Can I get banned for using VChanger?

You will not be banned directly for changing the background or voice lines, but this is an intrusion into the game files and can lead to your account being flagged. However, all tests have been successful and no account has been banned.

A Valorant subreddit mod said that they had reached out to Riot Support to find out if it's allowed and the team “strongly recommended” that players not change the background. Tampering with a game file can lead to permanent bans.

**IMPORTANT:**

Remember, however, that each player is responsible for the actions on his account. If you choose to use VChanger, it is your responsibility if you get banned for using it. I do not take any responsibility for any damage caused.
